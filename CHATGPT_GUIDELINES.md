# ChatGPT Collaboration Guidelines

These guidelines help maintain consistency, accuracy, and alignment when using ChatGPT for code, design, or content work.

---

## 1. Anchor the Context
- Summarize the current project, feature, or task before requesting output.
- Clearly state the specification or goal, including version numbers if relevant.
- Mention any changes or updates since the last session.

## 2. Confirm Understanding
- Ask ChatGPT to restate the plan or requirements before generating code or content.
- Compare its summary to your specification and correct any discrepancies early.

## 3. Control Scope
- Break large requests into smaller, focused steps.
- Specify what should not be changed (e.g., styles, file names, layouts).
- Use version tags or dates (e.g., “use design spec v1.3”) to lock reference points.

## 4. Generate and Verify
- After receiving output, check it against the specification.
- Test code or review content before moving on to the next step.
- Identify missing elements or unintended changes clearly.

## 5. Iterate Safely
- Provide precise feedback: describe the issue or desired outcome.
- Keep a running changelog or "Master Index" for reference in future sessions.

## 6. Reset When Needed
- If the conversation drifts off-spec, start a new chat and re-anchor with the latest specification.
- Maintain a clean baseline (ZIP, repository branch, or document) as a known-good reference.
